# Data structures

## Linked List
* python list is a dynamic array
* insertion in list / dyn array is O(n) (the swaps)
* Arrays insertion
    * if an element is inserted at pos 1 the proceedings elements are swapped a position 
    * And if the list goes out of bounds the entire list is copied to a new memory location
    * Note: list /dynamic array of size n pre-allocates 2n space in the memory
* insertion in the linked list is O(1) as here we do not need to swap elements
* Advantages of linked list over arrays
    * There is no need to pre-allocate space 
    * insertion is easier: just change the head and the next node pointer address
    * Traversal through a linked list : O(n)
    * Finding an element : O(n)

## Hashmap
* similar to an array with a string index instead of an integer index
* Hash function convertd the string key into an array index 
*Dictionary is a python specific implementation of Hashmap
* Look up by key is O(1) on average
* Insertion/Deletion is O(1) on avg
* Hash function
